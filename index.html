  Colour pallete is inspired by colours shown from http://colormind.io/bootstrap/
  I chose blue and green for my website because they represent the water and land of the earth. Which is part of the Treaty 1 agreement.
  Blue also represents peace, harmony and unity which is the whole reason for a treaty.

          <p>
            Each band received a large enough reserve to provide 160 acres for
            each family of five (or in proportion for smaller or larger
            families). Each person was given a one-time payment of three whole
            dollars, and a yearly payment of $15 per family of five. The
            government also agreed to have a school on each reserve and to
            forbid the introduction or selling of liquor on the reserves. For
            the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree, they were required to “cede,
            release, surrender, and yield up to her Majesty the Queen” a tract
            of land described in detail in the treaty: a large amount of
            present-day southeast and south-central Manitoba, which includes the
            Red River Valley, and stretching north to the low parts of Lake
            Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg and along the Assiniboine River to towns
            in Portage la Prairie and Brandon.
